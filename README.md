Problem Re-Written

    Start with a webpage that just creates a 16x16 grid of divs with Javascript
    Make it so that when the user mouses over parts of the grid, they get "activated" and stay active.
    Then add in a prompt that asks the user for how big of a grid they want.
        Do not let the max size be more than 100`

For extra credit

    have the squares change to a randon r,g,b value color
